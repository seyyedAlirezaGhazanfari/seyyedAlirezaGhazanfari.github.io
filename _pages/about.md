Hi, I'm Seyed Alireza Ghazanfari, a dedicated student and researcher passionate about the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence. I earned my bachelor's degree from Sharif University of Technology, where I developed a solid foundation in computer science and explored cutting-edge topics like cloud systems and computer vision.

My academic journey has been fueled by curiosity and a commitment to innovation. I've had the privilege of being a first author on a paper in computer vision and contributing to an AI4SE paper, experiences that have shaped my understanding of how AI can transform software engineering practices. My BSc project further deepened my interest in distributed systems and their potential to tackle real-world challenges.

Currently, I’m preparing for the next step in my academic career, with plans to pursue advanced studies in software engineering. My goal is to bridge gaps between research and practice, particularly by leveraging AI to enhance software development processes. Alongside my technical pursuits, I enjoy collaborating with like-minded individuals and engaging in interdisciplinary projects that push the boundaries of innovation.

Feel free to explore my work or reach out—I’d love to connect and discuss exciting ideas in technology and beyond!
